# Copilot CLI Setup Audit

This skill audits a repository's GitHub Copilot CLI customization setup and provides actionable recommendations.

## When to use this skill

- User asks to audit or review their Copilot setup
- User wants to optimize their CLI customization
- User asks "what's missing from my Copilot config?"
- Setting up a new project and want best-practice guidance

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Custom Instructions

Check for existence and content of:

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `copilot-instructions.md` | `.github/` | Repository-wide instructions |
| `*.instructions.md` | `.github/instructions/` | Path-specific instructions |
| `AGENTS.md` | Root directory | Agent instructions |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Root directory | Cross-tool compatibility |
| `GEMINI.md` | Root directory | Cross-tool compatibility |

**Validate:**

- YAML frontmatter is valid
- `applyTo` globs match intended files (for scoped instructions)
- Instructions are specific and actionable, not vague
- No conflicting instructions between files

### 2. Custom Agents

Check for agents in:

| Location | Type |
|----------|------|
| `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | Repository-level |
| `.claude/agents/*.agent.md` | Alternative project-level |
| `~/.copilot/agents/*.agent.md` | User-level |

**Validate:**

- `description` is present (required)
- `name` is present (recommended)
- `tools` list is explicit and minimal (security best practice)
- `target`, if present, is either `github-copilot` or `vscode`
- `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable` are intentional when present
- `mcp-servers`, if present, uses the MCP configuration schema
- Prompt text is under 30,000 characters

### 3. Agent Skills

Check for skills in:

| Location | Type |
|----------|------|
| `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Project skills |
| `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Alternative project skills |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Alternative project skills |
| `~/.copilot/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Personal skills |
| `~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Shared personal skills |

**Validate:**

- `name` and `description` are present in frontmatter
- Description is specific enough for Copilot to decide when to load
- Skill directory name matches the `name` field
- Optional `allowed-tools` is narrow and does not pre-approve shell access without a clear reason
- Optional `user-invocable` and `disable-model-invocation` fields match the intended invocation model
- Additional resources (scripts, examples) are referenced correctly

### 4. Hooks

Check for hooks in `.github/hooks/*.json`.

**Validate:**

- JSON is valid and uses `version: 1`
- Hook events are intentional (`sessionStart`, `preToolUse`, `permissionRequest`, `notification`, etc.)
- Command hooks use short timeouts and scoped working directories when possible
- HTTP hooks use HTTPS for security-sensitive events and avoid broad environment variable exposure

### 5. MCP Configuration

Check MCP configuration in:

| File | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `.github/mcp.json` | Repository |
| `.mcp.json` | Workspace |
| `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` | User |

Validate:

- Valid JSON structure
- Built-in MCP servers are understood: GitHub, Playwright, fetch, and time
- Any additional MCP servers configured
- Tool filters are explicit (`tools`) and do not expose more tools than needed
- Secrets are not committed; use environment expansion for sensitive values
- OAuth and `/mcp auth` requirements are documented for remote servers
- OIDC is only enabled for servers designed to receive Copilot-issued identity tokens
- `filterMapping` is intentional and safe for the server output shape
- Remote servers are trusted and comply with enterprise allowlists where applicable

### 6. Plugins

Check whether the repository relies on plugin-provided skills, agents, or commands.

**Validate:**

- Plugin usage is documented for collaborators
- Plugin-provided skills do not duplicate local project skills unless intentionally overridden
- Local customizations remain usable without private plugins when possible

### 7. Permission Policy

Check CLI permission defaults and documented automation patterns.

**Validate:**

- Automation examples use explicit `--allow-tool`, `--deny-tool`, `--allow-url`, and `--deny-url` patterns
- Shell approvals are scoped, for example `shell(git:*)`, instead of blanket `shell` where possible
- Dangerous operations such as `git push`, package publishing, or destructive filesystem commands are denied or gated
- `--allow-all` / `--yolo` is documented only for trusted local use, not shared automation

### 8. Programmatic Usage

Check whether the repository documents scripted or CI use of Copilot CLI.

**Validate:**

- Prompt-mode examples use `copilot --prompt` or `-p`
- Machine-readable output uses `--output-format=json` when downstream parsing is expected
- Non-interactive runs define needed tool, path, and URL permissions up front
- Token guidance prefers `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` and least-privilege fine-grained tokens
- Shared logs do not capture secrets, full prompts, or sensitive source snippets

### 9. OpenTelemetry Monitoring

Check whether monitoring is needed for team, CI, or enterprise usage.

**Validate:**

- OTel configuration is documented when agent usage must be observable
- OTel exporter variables such as `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` or `COPILOT_OTEL_FILE_EXPORTER_PATH` are intentional
- Content capture is disabled by default and only enabled in trusted environments
- Monitoring docs explain that traces can include agent turns, LLM calls, tool execution, token usage, and errors

### 10. Built-in Agents and Advanced Commands

Check whether built-in capabilities are documented before adding custom equivalents.

**Validate:**

- Built-in agents such as `explore`, `research`, `task`, `code-review`, and `general-purpose` are considered
- Advanced commands such as `/pr`, `/delegate`, `/remote`, `/keep-alive`, `/undo`, and `/rewind` are documented if used
- Experimental commands are marked as experimental where applicable

### 11. Alternative Command Format

Check for Claude-style command files if the repository uses cross-agent command workflows.

**Validate:**

- `.claude/commands/*.md` files are documented as lower-priority command-style alternatives to skills
- Command files do not duplicate higher-priority project skills unless intentionally overridden

### 12. Project-Type Detection

Detect the project type from:

- `package.json` → Node.js / JavaScript / TypeScript
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → Python
- `go.mod` → Go
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `*.csproj` / `*.sln` → .NET
- `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` → Java

Tailor recommendations to the detected project type.

## Common Recommendations

### For all projects

- Add `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with project context, build commands, and testing approach
- Add `AGENTS.md` at root with key conventions and architecture notes
- Create at least one custom agent for the project's primary workflow

### For specific languages

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**

- Add `*.instructions.md` with `applyTo: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"` for TS conventions
- Consider a skill for running/debugging tests

**Python:**

- Add instructions for virtual environment, linting (ruff/flake8), and type hints
- Consider a skill for package management (pip/poetry/uv)

**Go:**

- Add instructions for `go fmt`, `go vet`, and module conventions
- Consider a skill for Go test patterns

## Diagnostic Commands

Suggest the user run these in their Copilot CLI session:

```bash
/instructions    # View which instruction files are loaded
/skills list     # See available skills
/agent           # See available agents
/env             # Show loaded instructions, MCP servers, skills, agents, plugins, LSPs, and extensions
/mcp show        # Check MCP server configuration
/plugin list     # Check installed plugins
/usage           # Review session usage metrics
/context         # Inspect context window usage
```
